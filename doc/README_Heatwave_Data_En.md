# Heat Wave Analysis

Results from the heat wave analysis tool are returned in a zip file which, on unpacking, contains three csv files. These files contain the number of heat wave events, calculated according to your definition, for each climate model on a year by year basis (each row represents one year):
1. *_360_day.csv - this file contains those models having a 360-day year.
2. *_noleap.csv - this file contains those models having a 365-day year, and no leap years.
3. *_propleptic_gregorian.csv – this file contains those models which have 365-day years and every fourth year is a leap year containing 366 days.

The first column indicates the year, the second and third columns the latitude and longitude of your selected location and the following columns indicate the results for each climate model. These models are identified in the first row.
